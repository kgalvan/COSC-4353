HW2: Due 11:59PM February 9

In this homework we'll create an initial strategic design for a version of the Master Mind game.

Let's first discuss the version of the game that we'll design. We'll not be writing any code in this homework, but only create an initial strategic design.

The object of the game is for the user to guess the colors the program has
chosen. The program chooses six distinct colors from among ten colors. The user obviously does not know the colors the program has chosen.

The operations user can perform and the outcome:

User picks six colors:
The program displays a color code back to indicate the progress the user has made. 

If the user guessed the exact color combination, including the positions, the result is six black colors. The game ends now with a message that the user has won and the program reveals the color selected.

If the user guessed only some colors, then the result has as many black colors as the number of direct positions matches and as many silver colors for each match that is in an incorrect position.

For example, if the program selected green, red, blue, white, orange, purple, and the user entered cyan, yellow, blue, orange, violet, red, then the program will display black, silver, silver.

User gives up: 
The program displays the colors selected, game ends with a message the user has lost.

User has made 20 tries:
The program displays the colors selected, game ends with a message the user has lost (unless in the last try the user found the combination).

1. How would you design this program? 

First, the colors would be decided by a random number generator that will choose and integer from 1 to 10 and a switch statement matching each possible number to a color string. This will be stored in an array of size 6. The interface would have a text prompt at the top with space for 6 rectangles underneath. Each will have a textbox in it where the user can input their guesses. If the user gets colors in the correct position, that amount of rectangles will be black and if they get a color correct without the position, that amount of rectangles will be grey in that order from left to right. All other rectangles will be left transparent. At which point a counter at the top right corner will tick down from 20 each time a guess is made unsuccessfully. The matches are checked using an array of strings to store all of the users guesses. Anytime a value and index match it will increase a counter keeping track of black rectangles and anytime a value matches without taking into account the index, it will increase a counter for grey rectangles. If all 6 match color and index, the program will color each rectangle and submit a message letting the user know they won. At the bottom will be a submit button to submit the users answer and a Forfeit button for the user to quit.

2. Discuss what language you would use, how you'd structure the program, what libraries you'd use? What library do you plan to use to create the GUI?

We would use Java to program the game with Swing to make the GUI. There would be 2 string arrays holding the names of the colors. One for the game to hold its randomly assigned colors and one to hold the responses from the user. There would be a counter for the amount of attempts left beginning with 20. There would also be two counters set to 0 each time the user submits their answers. One will hold the amount of guesses that match color and location and the second to count the amount of guesses that only match color.The interface would have text at the top center with the counter at the top right and 6 shapes underneath it with textboxes in each for the user input. Underneath would be two centered buttons side-by-side. On the left for Forfeit to quit the game and on the right for Submit to submit the answers. The program will add each of the users responses to the players array and compare it to all the responses from the games array in a double for loop. Any match will check for a match in index and break the loop to avoid counting repeats. each of the last two counters will be updated accordingly. If the first counter gets to 6, the game is over and the program will display all six colors and a message saying the user won. If not, it will display the amount of black colors for the first counter and silver for the second counter and the counter will reduce by 1. If the attempt counter gets down to 0, the game will display the 6 correct colors and give a message showing the player lost. If the user clicks forfeit, a dialog will show up asking the user if they're sure and the game will show the 6 correct colors and a message saying that the user lost. The forfeit button will be replaced with a try again button at which point the game begins again.

3. Include a separate file (may be a scan of hand drawn picture if you like, or a pdf, tiff, word document, etc.) which shows a UML diagram of your design.
