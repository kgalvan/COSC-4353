synopsis: let's change direction 

details:                        
Please delete the tests and code so far.

Let's change direction, we will focus on some interesting behavior instead of state.

Start with a protected constructor that takes a collection of colors. These are the colors we can assume the application has pre-selected for the user. Then let's focus on these tests:

user guesses correctly no color
user guesses one color but not in the right position
user guesses one color in the right position
user guesses two color, one in the right position
user guesses all colors in the right positions 

For these tests, we need only one constructor and one method, let's call it guess.

synopsis: let's follow Java coding standards 

details:

Let's follow Java coding standards:
Class names start with uppercase letter.

Method names start with lowercase letter.

Let's move assign2test to MasterMindTest
Let's move assign2 to MasterMind           

In addition to canary test, write either one or two tests and absolutely minimum code to make those one or two tests to pass. Write as little as possible.

I have setup a gradle build file for you and have integrated that into the continuous integration alsoâ€”see build.bat in your repository root directory.

To run gradle, you may do *one* of the following steps:

1. from the command line, run ./gradlew on unix-like system or gradlew.bat on Windows. You may continue to use your IDE for writing and running code/tests. The CI machine will run the gradle build file automatically. If you add dependencies to your project, remember to add those dependencies to the build.gradle file.

2. Integrate your IDE to use gradle. For this you will have to setup the project as a gradle project if you like to go this route, you may Google for steps that are specific to the IDE you're using.

Please make sure that the build passes (all tests pass) upon each commit. If a build fails, please fix the build right away. Either make change to fix the build or roll back the code change to fix the build (and then try again once you figure out what's going on).
