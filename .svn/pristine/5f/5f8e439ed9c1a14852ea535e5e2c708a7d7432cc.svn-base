synopsis: nice focus for the start 

details:
Please remove all commented out code.
Please give one space after comma.

I like your focus to start with - on the score. Good job.

Once we start with a function's design, we stay with that function's design to complete that. So, let's keep our focus on getScore.

Notice the field int score. That is state. We do not want to add state to objects unless we can't avoid it. Be very reluctant adding state.

Let's delete all the code and rework the design.

getScore can take two parameters: a scrambledWord and a guessWord.

Let's pass a scrambledWord word, say oekmny. Let's pass an empty string for the guessWord. Assert score is 0. 

Then let's write more tests for getScore. Let's keep our focus on only getScore.

At this time in the design, we'll need one method getScore, no fields.
