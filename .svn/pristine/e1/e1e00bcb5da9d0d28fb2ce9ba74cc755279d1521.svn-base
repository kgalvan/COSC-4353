synopsis: gradlew is missing 

details:                    

Please notice that gradlew is missing in assign3 and that is needed to run the build on non-Windows.

> ./gradlew
-bash: ./gradlew: No such file or directory

Remove all comments. Please take small steps. Design one function first, get that reviewed, then design another function after that.

Give good variable names.
